We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4. At the end of your response, remember to put your final answer within \\boxed{}. For example: \"So the 11th generation ancestor of 'Tamara Watkins' is \\boxed{somebody (your answer here)}.\"\n\nNow, the scrambled family relationships are provided below:\nNicholas Jackson is not only Joseph Simmons's father but also Joseph Simmons's role model.For Curtis Bauer, Joseph Simmons is not just a maternal grandfather, but also a friend.Michael Parker's dad is Curtis Bauer.For Christopher Beltran, Michael Parker is more than just a mom; Michael Parker is a lifelong mentor of Christopher Beltran.For Randall Dorsey, Christopher Johnson is more than just a paternal grandfather; Christopher Johnson is a lifelong mentor of Randall Dorsey.Christopher Beltran, as Christopher Johnson's paternal grandfather, has a significant impact on Christopher Johnson's upbringing.Randall Dorsey is not only Kristy Stevens's mom but also Kristy Stevens's role model.During Tamara Watkins's upbringing, Kristy Stevens was not only Tamara Watkins's mom, but also Tamara Watkins's guardian.\n\nGiven the scrambled family relationships described above, who is the 11th generation ancestor of 'Tamara Watkins'?\n"
