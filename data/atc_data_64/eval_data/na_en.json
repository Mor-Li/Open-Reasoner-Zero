        "value": "Here is a test for multi-step reasoning ability called the Ancestral Trace Challenge. In this test, we will simulate different people's familial relationships, and your task is to identify a specific ancestor of a given person.\n\nFor example:\nExample 1: If James Hill's father is Jasmine Lane, then Jasmine Lane is James Hill's 1st generation ancestor.\nExample 2: If Andrew Williams's grandmother is Dan Newton (grandmother counts as 2 generations), and Dan Newton's father is James Hill, then Dan Newton is Andrew Williams's 2nd generation ancestor, and James Hill is Andrew Williams's 3rd generation ancestor.\nExample 3: If Shelley Mills's grandfather is Jeff White (grandfather counts as 2 generations), and Jeff White's mother is Mary Johnson, then Jeff White is Shelley Mills's 2nd generation ancestor, and Mary Johnson is Shelley Mills's 3rd generation ancestor.\n\nNotes:\n1. You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4. At the end of your response, remember to put your final answer within \\boxed{}.
