For example:\nExample 1: If Jasmine Lane is James Hill's father (father counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between James Hill and Jasmine Lane is 1.\nExample 2: If Dan Newton is Andrew Williams's grandmother (grandmother counts as 2 generations), and James Hill is Dan Newton's father (father counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between Andrew Williams and Dan Newton is 2, and the relationship distance between Andrew Williams and James Hill is 3.\nExample 3: If Jeff White is Shelley Mills's grandfather (grandfather counts as 2 generations), and Mary Johnson is Jeff White's mother (mother counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between Shelley Mills and Jeff White is 2, and the relationship distance between Shelley Mills and Mary Johnson is 3.\n\nNotes:\n1. You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about relationship connections.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4. At the end of your response, remember to put your final answer within \\boxed{}. For example: \"So the relationship distance between 'Casey Salinas' and 'Ronald Peters' is \\boxed{5}.\"\n\nNow, the scrambled family relationships are provided below:\nRuben Sanchez is not only Patricia Guerrero's paternal grandfather but also Patricia Guerrero's role model.Renee Adams is not only James Cook's grandfather but also James Cook's role model.Martin Sweeney, as Ruben Sanchez's mom, has a significant impact on Ruben Sanchez's upbringing.During Renee Adams's upbringing, Casey Salinas was not only Renee Adams's mother, but also Renee Adams's guardian.Ronald Peters's mom is Karen Robertson.During Martin Sweeney's upbringing, James Cook was not only Martin Sweeney's maternal grandmother, but also Martin Sweeney's guardian.For Jason Hill, Patricia Guerrero is not just a grandmother, but also a friend.During Karen Robertson's upbringing, Jason Hill was not only Karen Robertson's mom, but also Karen Robertson's guardian.\n\nGiven the scrambled family relationships described above, what is the relationship distance between 'Casey Salinas' and 'Ronald Peters'?\n"

        "value": "Here is a test for multi-step reasoning ability called the Ancestral Trace Challenge. In this test, we will simulate different people's familial relationships, and your task is to calculate the relationship distance between two individuals.\n\nThe relationship distance is defined as the minimum number of generational gaps needed to go from one person to another in the family graph. Note that different relationships have different generational gaps. For example:\nExample 1: If Jasmine Lane is James Hill's father (father counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between James Hill and Jasmine Lane is 1.\nExample 2: If Dan Newton is Andrew Williams's grandmother (grandmother counts as 2 generations), and James Hill is Dan Newton's father (father counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between Andrew Williams and Dan Newton is 2, and the relationship distance between Andrew Williams and James Hill is 3.\nExample 3: If Jeff White is Shelley Mills's grandfather (grandfather counts as 2 generations), and Mary Johnson is Jeff White's mother (mother counts as 1 generation), then the relationship distance between Shelley Mills and Jeff White is 2, and the relationship distance between Shelley Mills and Mary Johnson is 3.\n\nNotes:\n1. You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about relationship connections.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4.
