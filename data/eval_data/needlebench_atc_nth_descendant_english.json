You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4.

You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues.

You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues.

        "value": "Here is a test for multi-step reasoning ability called the Ancestral Trace Challenge. In this test, we will simulate different people's familial relationships, and your task is to identify a specific descendant of a given person.\n\nFor example:\nExample 1: If Jasmine Lane is James Hill's father, then James Hill is Jasmine Lane's 1st generation descendant.\nExample 2: If Dan Newton is Andrew Williams's grandmother (grandmother counts as 2 generations), and James Hill is Dan Newton's father, then Andrew Williams is Dan Newton's 2nd generation descendant, and Andrew Williams is James Hill's 3rd generation descendant.\nExample 3: If Jeff White is Shelley Mills's grandfather (grandfather counts as 2 generations), and Mary Johnson is Jeff White's mother, then Shelley Mills is Jeff White's 2nd generation descendant, and Shelley Mills is Mary Johnson's 3rd generation descendant.\n\nNotes:\n1. You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4.
