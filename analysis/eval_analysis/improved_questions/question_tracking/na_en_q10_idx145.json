User: You must put your answer inside <answer> </answer> tags, i.e., <answer> answer here </answer>. And your final answer will be extracted automatically by the \\boxed{} tag.\nThis is the problem:\nHere is a test for multi-step reasoning ability called the Ancestral Trace Challenge. In this test, we will simulate different people's familial relationships, and your task is to identify a specific ancestor of a given person.\n\nFor example:\nExample 1: If James Hill's father is Jasmine Lane, then Jasmine Lane is James Hill's 1st generation ancestor.\nExample 2: If Andrew Williams's grandmother is Dan Newton (grandmother counts as 2 generations), and Dan Newton's father is James Hill, then Dan Newton is Andrew Williams's 2nd generation ancestor, and James Hill is Andrew Williams's 3rd generation ancestor.\nExample 3: If Shelley Mills's grandfather is Jeff White (grandfather counts as 2 generations), and Jeff White's mother is Mary Johnson, then Jeff White is Shelley Mills's 2nd generation ancestor, and Mary Johnson is Shelley Mills's 3rd generation ancestor.\n\nNotes:\n1. You do not need to worry about the gender consistency of names in this test. We only care about generational relationships.\n2. Ignore surname inheritance issues. We only care about familial relationships.\n3. Father/mother/dad/mom count as 1 generation, while grandfather/grandmother/maternal grandmother/maternal grandfather/paternal grandfather/paternal grandmother count as 2 generations.\n4. At the end of your response, remember to put your final answer within \\boxed{}. For example: \"So the 14th generation ancestor of 'Isabel Salas' is \\boxed{somebody (your answer here)}.\"\n\nNow, the scrambled family relationships are provided below:\nChristine Matthews DDS, as Isabel Salas's paternal grandfather, has a significant impact on Isabel Salas's upbringing.Paul Sutton is not only Christine Matthews DDS's grandmother but also Christine Matthews DDS's role model.Kayla Burke, as Tonya Parrish MD's mom, has a significant impact on Tonya Parrish MD's upbringing.David Jones, as Paul Cook's mother, has a significant impact on Paul Cook's upbringing.For Kayla Burke, Paul Cook is more than just a grandfather; Paul Cook is a lifelong mentor of Kayla Burke.Jill Ingram is Alexis Smith's maternal grandmother.David Jones's maternal grandmother is Alexis Smith.For Paul Sutton, Tonya Parrish MD is more than just a paternal grandfather; Tonya Parrish MD is a lifelong mentor of Paul Sutton.\n\nGiven the scrambled family relationships described above, who is the 14th generation ancestor of 'Isabel Salas'?\n\nAssistant: <think>",

Thus, we assume Jill Ingram is an adult figure without known children, making her the closest parent in the lineage we need to trace.\n8. **Identify spontaneous links**: There are no further links between Jill Ingram and other known figures.
